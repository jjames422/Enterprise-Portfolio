# PCI DSS Compliant Architecture

This document provides a detailed overview of an architecture designed to meet the **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)** requirements for secure payment processing.

---

## Objectives of PCI DSS Compliance
1. Protect cardholder data.
2. Maintain a secure network.
3. Monitor and test networks regularly.
4. Implement strong access control measures.

---

## Key Components of the Architecture
### **1. Segmentation of Cardholder Data Environment (CDE)**
- The **Cardholder Data Environment (CDE)** is isolated using firewalls to prevent unauthorized access.
- All payment-related servers (e.g., payment gateways, transaction processors) reside in a secure **private subnet**.

### **2. Encryption**
- Use **AES-256 encryption** for data at rest and TLS 1.2/1.3 for data in transit.
- Store encryption keys securely using **AWS Key Management Service (KMS)** or **Azure Key Vault**.

### **3. Access Control**
- Implement **role-based access control (RBAC)**.
- Require **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** for access to systems handling cardholder data.

### **4. Logging and Monitoring**
- Centralize logs using **Splunk** or **ELK Stack** for real-time monitoring.
- Set up **AWS CloudTrail**, **Azure Monitor**, or **GCP Operations Suite** for tracking access and changes.

### **5. Secure Payment Gateway Integration**
- Use **tokenization** to replace sensitive cardholder data with a unique token.
- Ensure that third-party integrations meet **PCI DSS Level 1** certification.

## High-Level Architecture Design
1. **VPC and Subnet Segmentation**:
   - Public Subnet: Contains web servers and load balancers.
   - Private Subnet: Contains the application and database servers handling payment data.
   - Management Subnet: Contains monitoring and logging tools.

2. **Firewalls and Security Groups**:
   - Restrict inbound/outbound traffic using granular security rules.
   - Allow only port 443 (HTTPS) from trusted IPs.

3. **Encryption Layers**:
   - Encrypt payment data before storing it in the database.
   - Secure backup storage with AES-256 encryption.

4. **Intrusion Detection and Prevention**:
   - Deploy **IDS/IPS** systems like **Snort** or **AWS GuardDuty**.

---

## Deployment Steps
1. **Network Configuration**:
   - Create VPC with public and private subnets.
   - Configure NAT Gateway for private subnets.

2. **Application Layer**:
   - Deploy a web application behind an **Application Load Balancer** (ALB).
   - Integrate with a PCI DSS-certified payment gateway.

3. **Database Layer**:
   - Deploy a **PostgreSQL** or **MySQL** database in the private subnet.
   - Enable encryption at rest.

4. **Compliance Validation**:
   - Conduct vulnerability scans using tools like **Qualys** or **Nessus**.
   - Perform penetration testing regularly.

## Benefits
- Ensures protection of cardholder data.
- Meets regulatory requirements for PCI DSS compliance.
- Reduces risk of data breaches.

## Tools and Frameworks
- **AWS**: VPC, KMS, CloudTrail, RDS, GuardDuty.
- **Azure**: Virtual Network, Key Vault, Monitor, SQL Database.
- **GCP**: VPC, Cloud KMS, Security Command Center.
- **Splunk/ELK**: Centralized logging and monitoring.
- **Qualys/Nessus**: Vulnerability management and scanning.
