# Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

This folder contains examples and configurations demonstrating my expertise in deploying secure, scalable solutions on GCP.

## Highlights

1. **Firewall Policies**: Secure VPCs with restricted SSH access and HTTPS traffic.
2. **Compute Engine**: Automated deployment of web servers using Terraform.
3. **Network Diagrams**: Visual representations of secure architectures.

## Files

- **GCP-Firewall-Policy.yaml**: YAML configuration for GCP firewall rules.
- **GCP-Compute-VM.tf**: Terraform script to deploy a Compute Engine instance with a web server.
- **GCP-Network-Diagram.png**: Visual representation of the architecture.

## Deployment

1. Use `gcloud` CLI to apply firewall rules.
2. Use Terraform to deploy Compute Engine instances.
3. Refer to the network diagram for a high-level overview of the architecture.
