Explanation of the Code
	1.	bindings: Specifies role bindings for IAM.
	2.	role: Specifies the predefined IAM role:
	•	roles/storage.objectViewer: Grants read-only access to storage objects.
	•	roles/storage.objectAdmin: Grants administrative permissions for storage objects.
	3.	members: Lists the users or service accounts granted the role.
	•	user:example-user@example.com: Grants access to a specific user.
	4.	condition: Adds conditions to the IAM role binding for enhanced control:
	•	Temporary Access:
	•	Limits the role to a specific time frame using request.time.
	•	Tag-Based Access:
	•	Restricts access to resources tagged with enterprise-project.

How to Use
	1.	Save the file as GCP-Conditional-Role-Binding.json.
	2.	Apply the policy using the Google Cloud CLI:

gcloud projects set-iam-policy [PROJECT_ID] GCP-Conditional-Role-Binding.json

Replace [PROJECT_ID] with your Google Cloud project ID.

	3.	To verify the applied policy, run:

gcloud projects get-iam-policy [PROJECT_ID]

Customizations
	•	Add More Members: Extend the members array to include more users or service accounts.
	•	Change Roles: Replace roles/storage.objectViewer or roles/storage.objectAdmin with other predefined roles as needed.
	•	Adjust Conditions: Update the expression field to enforce other dynamic rules, such as location-based or workload identity bindings.
