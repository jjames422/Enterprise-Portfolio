# Blockchain Performance Benchmarking

This document outlines performance testing conducted on the blockchain network to validate its suitability for Fortune 100 clients.

## Tools Used
- **Hyperledger Caliper**: For end-to-end performance testing.
- **JMeter**: For simulating API gateway calls.
- **Grafana**: For monitoring node performance.

## Metrics
| Metric                  | Result                  |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| Transactions per Second | 10,000 TPS             |
| Latency                 | 120 ms per transaction |
| Node Sync Time          | < 2 minutes            |
| Fault Tolerance         | Handles 33% node failure |

## Recommendations
1. Use horizontal scaling for validator nodes to maintain throughput under load.
2. Optimize block size and gas limits for high-value enterprise transactions.
3. Use sharding for parallel transaction processing.
